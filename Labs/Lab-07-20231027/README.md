# Software Architecture and Platforms - a.y. 2023-2024

## Lab #07-20231027 - [Repo](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024.git) 

In [previous lab (20231020)](https://github.com/pslab-unibo/sap-2023-2024/blob/master/Labs/Lab-06-20231020/README.md) and in module 2.3 we dug into microservices and the design of microservices.

 In this lab, we see the design and prototype implementation of a simple example/system based on microservice architecture: the [Cooperative PixelArt System](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1tZgkVA_i08DHmW3Wnpnq-AIvbmVA3CMiGn1aWEBDZYM/edit?usp=sharing) (same example see in PCD course). Key points:
- how to design a microservice adopting a clean architecture, exposing a REST API
- how to design a library based on a service proxy, to interact with the microservice

Tool of the day:  [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
- editor/tool ecosystem to work with API
- based on [Open API 3.0 standard](https://www.openapis.org/)
